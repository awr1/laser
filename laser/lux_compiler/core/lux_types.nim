    # ################### Statements #########################
    # Statements are generate when the high-level functional AST
    # is lowered to an AST that more closely match Nim's AST.

    # Scalar statements
    Assign

    # Affine loop statements
    AffineFor   # Affine for loop
    AffineIf    # Affine if

    # Affine statements:
    # - for/if constraints are a linear expression of
    #   the function invariants and the iterator indices.
    #   with i and j iterator indices and M, N invariants,
    #   Here is an overview of affine/non-affine conditions:
    #   - for i in 0 ..< 10    is valid
    #   - for i in 0 ..< N     is valid
    #   - for i in j ..< 2j+10 is valid
    #   - for i in j ..< M*N   is valid
    #   - for i in j ..< j*j   is invalid, as it's quadratic (j is not an invariant)
    #   - if 2*i - 3*j == 0    is valid
    #   - if i*j < 20          is invalid, as it's quadratic
    #
    # Note: We may extend to "if" with modulo and division by a runtime invariant
    #       which will make it a quasi-affine statement.
    #       - A non-unit step in the for-loop is quasi-affine.
    #       - This will also allows branching depending of
    #         fraction if CPU/GPU charatectristics like cache or TLB size
